# MEDB
## Milestone 1
Supports update, select, delete, and sum.

Maintains a hash-table based index over the key column specified when creating the table. There is currently no support for creating multiple indexes over multiple columns. For this milestone, only one index is maintained at a time. The index can, however, be indexed over a column with duplicate values (i.e. not all key values have to be unique).

test script should be located in the same directory as the source code (just like tester.py). db.py should be imported using 'from db import Database', and query.py should be imported using 'from query import Query'.

## Milestone 2
Provides support for memory persistence. Also incorporates merging and central
buffer pool used by all tables/threads.

Some extraneous code has been removed and replced by function calls.
